## Introduction
This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline for deploying a static website using GitHub and Jenkins.

## Tools Used
- HTML, CSS
- GitHub
- Jenkins (Localhost)
- Python (for local server)

## Working
Whenever code is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code, performs basic checks, and runs a local server to host the website.

## Output
Jenkins console shows a local URL which can be opened in the browser to view the deployed website.

## Conclusion
